# SER225 Platformer Game

## What is this?
This is a platformer game with the goal of traversing through each platforming to finish the game. There are various kinds of enemies and obstacles that you will need to avoid. There are six levels that you need to complete to finish the game. There are also coins on each level for you to collect.  

 

## How to run this project?
I did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Java (min version 8).
I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.
